Webeyez monitors your business and technical performance and alerts you about drops in KPI which are caused by tech issues.

== Description ==

From small e-commerce shops to big online retailers, Webeyez helps you connect between business and technical performance. After installing the Webeyez extension, you receive full visibility in to your business  and technological performance. All goals are monitored automatically and you receive alerts about drops in the number of goal hits and how technology is affecting this count.

The Webeyez extension gathers all business and technological performance and presents it on the Webeyez platform.

It’s a known fact that technology performance directly affects business performance. The simplest example is page load time. Conversion rate drops and bounce rate increase with every added second of load time. There are many tech issues which affect business performance like downtime, call to actions that don’t work, server errors, errors on the browser and much more. 

With Webeyez we have you covered. We monitor 100% of your real users business and technology performance, present you with current and historical performance and alert you about anomalies in both business and tech performance.

For example you can receive an alert about a drop in the number of orders which is caused by an increase of specific server error.
